> # To-Do.

* **Use A Discord CSS Injector To Use the Theme.**

<br/>

> # Future.

* I will add more style when I will have time.
* I do not use discord much so I didn't cover everything.

<br/>

> # Warning.

* ***If you have any suggestions, problems, open a problem (if it is an error, you must be sure to look if you can solve it with [Google](https://giybf.com)!)***
